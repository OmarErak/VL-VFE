# VL-VFE
This repository contains the codes for the variable-length variational feature encoding (VL-VFE) method proposed in the paper "Learning Task-Oriented Communication for Edge Inference: An Information Bottleneck Method". (The VFE method proposed in this paper can be achieved by replacing the function $\gamma$ with a $\mu$ vector and fixing the channel noise level $\sigma$)
